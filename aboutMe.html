<p style = "margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;font-family:Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;font-size:16px;"> Hey guys, My Name is Adham Oudeif. I am 21 years old and am a current Junior at EMU. I was born in Arizona, but was raised all over the world due to the nomadic lifestyle our family took on because of my Fathers job. I am from a great village in Yemen and am extremely proud of my roots. I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science.

 

My family and culture are very tribal, and we uphold our roots and have pride so that the generations that come after us know who they are, and where they need to go. Currently my family resides here after coming from Yemen before I was born. Their intent was to create better lives for us, so that we may one day bring prosperity back to our homes.

I have played sports all throughout my schooling, and at the moment am pursing Jiu Jitsu at the EMU club under Chris Hutchcraft. I like to play video games every now and then, mainly online games with friends. On the side, I try to make and contribute to the making of films. My most recent film is a medieval short with horses, swords, and great costumes! You can catch the trailer on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yKkhDckhjo" a:link {

<h2 style="color:purple"><i>Dreams &amp; Goals</i></h2>

<p style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;font-family:Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;font-size:16px;">
 I have many dreams and goals but the most tangible one right now is gaining my degree in Comp Sci and getting a good job ASAP. I started my major courses this semester, so I have to work a bit harder to catch up to my peers. I will be working on side projects and building my skill up this semester and the coming summer. Hopefully by next summer I will receive an internship and from there a job. On the side I also hope to get good enough at BJJ to enter a tournament this April and try to beat the best at my level! Also, I am working on this medieval film and am reshooting many scenes in march and April and will have it done by summer so by then I can work on the sequel.<br>I think my greatest asset in life have been my soft skills that I gained working as a Samsung sales rep up until now. I feel that building these skills will give me a leg up against my peers, but I still have to work hard to be on their level. In the end, I hope to be able to juggle all these hopes and aspirations while doing my duty in this world as man- Raising a strong family, being a good role model for my people, and staying faithful to The Truth.
